# pi-interactive-subagents

Async subagents for [pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), running in Zellij panes. Spawn a sub-agent, keep working in the main session, and get the result steered back when it finishes. Fully non-blocking.

Requires **Zellij 0.44+**. See [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgements) for the upstream project.

## How it works

`subagent()` returns immediately. The sub-agent runs in its own pane without stealing keyboard focus: a new pane in the parent's Zellij tab. A live widget above the input tracks every running sub-agent, and when one finishes, its result is steered into the main session as a notification that triggers a new turn.

```
╭─ Subagents ──────────────────────────── 2 running ─╮
│ 00:23  scout      active · bash 7m                 │
│ 00:45  scout-2    waiting 2m                       │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Spawn several in parallel — they run concurrently and steer results back independently as each finishes.

Pane placement follows your existing Zellij layout, including horizontal and vertical splits. The extension does not replace layouts or force equal-width columns. Keep `auto_layout true` in your Zellij configuration to let Zellij automatically rearrange panes on creation and removal. Pane operations are implemented in `pi-extension/subagents/zellij.ts`.

Zellij creation uses `--near-current-pane` without `--direction`: placement follows the layout and keyboard focus is preserved, even when another tab is active. All reads, messages and closes target explicit pane IDs. Older Zellij releases are rejected because they lack the required pane-targeted CLI actions.

On parent shutdown or `/reload`, the extension attempts to close its tracked subagent panes. Uncertain pane creation or command delivery is not automatically retried; inspect the reported pane or creation marker before retrying.

Launches record the child process ID before execution. If the process exits or its pane is closed without a completion marker, the watcher confirms this on the next poll, removes the task from the running list, and reports an interruption. A surviving shell is left open. Idle processes, interrupted generation (Esc), and failed CLI queries are not treated as process exits.

If your shell startup is slow and launch commands get dropped before the prompt is ready, raise the delay:

```bash
export PI_SUBAGENT_SHELL_READY_DELAY_MS=2500   # default: 500
```

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent` | Spawn a sub-agent in a dedicated Zellij pane (async) |
| `subagent_message` | Message a sub-agent by name — steers it if running, resumes its session if finished |
| `subagents_list` | List available agent definitions |
| `ask_question` | *(sub-agent sessions only)* Ask the orchestrator a question and wait for the reply |

There is also a `/subagent <agent> <task>` command for spawning directly.

### Spawning

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "scout", task: "Analyze the auth module" });
subagent({ agent: "worker", name: "dark-mode", task: "Implement the dark mode toggle" });
```

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
| --------- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `agent` | string | required | Which agent to spawn (must be known and permitted) |
| `task` | string | required | Task prompt |
| `name` | string | agent name | Display name for the pane and widget. Must be unique — duplicates are auto-suffixed (`scout`, `scout-2`, …) |
| `model` | string | agent's model | Override the model for this spawn |
| `cwd` | string | agent's `cwd` | Working directory (see [Role folders](#role-folders)) |

### Messaging

`subagent_message` is addressed **by name only**. Names are unique per session and persist after a sub-agent finishes, so the same name works either way:

```typescript
subagent_message({ name: "scout", message: "Also check the auth middleware" });
```

- **Running** — the message is typed into the live pane (newlines flattened) and picked up at the next turn boundary. The call returns immediately; the eventual completion still arrives as a steer message.
- **Finished** — the session is resumed with the message as the follow-up task, like a fresh spawn: fire-and-forget, always autonomous, result steered back later. The resumed run reclaims its original name.

Every spawn records name → session file in `artifacts/<sessionId>/subagent-registry.json`, so names stay addressable across pi restarts. A nested sub-agent that spawns children gets its own registry keyed by its own session id. Resume is refused with a clear error (listing known names) if the name isn't registered, the session file is gone, or the session predates sandboxed resume.

**Resume replays the saved loadout.** The optional tool allowlist, model, thinking level, system prompt, spawn whitelist, cwd, and config directory are snapshotted to `<session>.loadout.json`. Resume restores those settings; extensions are discovered from the current configuration, not frozen at spawn time.

### ask_question

A sub-agent can ask its orchestrator a single freeform question when requirements are ambiguous or a decision materially affects the work. The session **stays open** (parked as `waiting`) instead of exiting; the parent is notified with the sub-agent's name, replies via `subagent_message({ name, message })`, and the reply arrives as the sub-agent's next turn. Parallel questions are supported — each waiting sub-agent has its own name.

If the reply arrives while the sub-agent is still mid-turn, it is absorbed into the current turn — either way the question is marked answered and the session exits normally when the work is done. If the parent never replies, the pane stays open until a human closes it. Only available inside sub-agent sessions.

## Bundled agents

| Agent | Model | Tools | Role |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| **scout** | `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` | `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls`, `mcp` | Fast read-only codebase recon |
| **researcher** | `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` | `web_search`, `source_check`, `fetch_content`, `get_search_content`, `safe_bash` | Web research, synthesized into a sourced brief |
| **worker** | pi default | `read`, `write`, `edit`, `bash`, `web_search`, `source_check`, `fetch_content`, `get_search_content` + spawning | General implementer; may spawn `scout` and `researcher` |

All three are autonomous (`auto-exit: true`) and carry their identity in the system prompt (`system-prompt: append`).

## Custom agents

Place a `.md` file in `.pi/agents/` (project) or `~/.pi/agent/agents/` (global). Discovery priority: **project > global > package-bundled** — a project-local file overrides a bundled agent with the same name.

```markdown
---
name: my-agent
description: Does something specific
model: openrouter/z-ai/glm-5.3
thinking: medium
tools: read, edit, write, safe_bash, web_search
session-mode: lineage-only
auto-exit: true
---

You are a specialized agent that does X...
```

### Frontmatter reference

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name` | string | Agent name (used in `agent: "my-agent"`) |
| `description` | string | Shown in `subagents_list` |
| `model` | string | Default model |
| `thinking` | string | `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, or `high` |
| `tools` | string | Optional comma-separated tool allowlist, passed as `--tools`. Omit or leave empty for the default full toolset. Extensions load normally in both cases; no tool-to-extension path mapping is needed. `ask_question` is added automatically, as are spawning tools when `subagent_agents` grants delegation |
| `subagent_agents` | string | Comma-separated agent names this agent may spawn. **Presence of this field grants the spawning toolset** (`subagent`, `subagent_message`, `subagents_list`) and restricts spawn targets to the list. Omit it and the agent cannot spawn at all |
| `skills` | string | Comma-separated skill names to auto-load |
| `session-mode` | string | `standalone` (default), `lineage-only`, or `fork` — see below |
| `system-prompt` | string | `append` or `replace`: pass the body as the child's `--append-system-prompt` / `--system-prompt`. Omit and the body is prepended to the task prompt instead |
| `auto-exit` | boolean | Auto-shutdown when the agent finishes (see below) |
| `interactive` | boolean | Whether stall/recovery transitions wake the parent (see below) |
| `cwd` | string | Default working directory |
| `disable-model-invocation` | boolean | Hide from `subagents_list`; still spawnable by explicit name |
| `cli` | string | `claude` runs the agent via the Claude Code CLI instead of pi |

### session-mode

- `standalone` — fresh session, no lineage link to the caller (default)
- `lineage-only` — fresh session with `parentSession` linkage for discovery/fork UX, but no copied turns
- `fork` — child session seeded with the caller's conversation context

### auto-exit

With `auto-exit: true`, the session shuts down when the agent's turn ends — the agent just writes its final message and stops (there is no "done" tool). The last assistant message becomes the summary returned to the parent. Recommended for all autonomous agents.

Notes:

- **Manual input does not strand an auto-exit sub-agent.** If a human types into the pane, the session still closes once that turn completes normally — only an escape/abort leaves it open.
- **Auto-exit is suppressed while work is in flight:** the session parks as `waiting` instead of exiting when an `ask_question` is still unanswered, or when the agent's own child sub-agents are still running (a worker can stop after dispatching children and stays open until the last result returns).

### interactive

Controls whether `stalled`/`recovered` status transitions send a steer message to the parent session. Defaults to the inverse of `auto-exit`: autonomous agents get stall pings; user-driven agents stay quiet (the user is already working in that pane — the widget still updates). Set explicitly to override.

## Tool access control

Tool restrictions are **optional**:

- With `tools`: pass `--tools <allowlist>` (including child control tools).
- Without `tools` (or with an empty value): omit `--tools` and use Pi's default full toolset, even when `subagent_agents` is configured.
- In both cases, extensions are discovered normally from the child's configuration; no `--no-extensions` or third-party tool-path mapping is used. Package-local helpers (`ask_question`, `safe_bash`, and delegation support) are still explicitly loaded as needed.

The saved tool allowlist survives resume. It limits model-callable tools, not extension initialization, event hooks, or background tasks; this is not a security sandbox. Only enable extensions that are suitable for running in child processes.

Spawns must name a known agent at **every** depth. A top-level session may spawn anything discoverable; a sub-agent may only spawn the agents in its `subagent_agents` list (enforced via `PI_SUBAGENT_ALLOWED`). There is no agentless spawn route, so a child can never escalate to a full-toolset profile by omitting its agent.

Install and enable tool-providing packages normally, for example `pi install npm:pi-web-access` or `pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter`. Their tools can then be named in `tools`, without registering extension paths. Older sessions with a saved `web_fetch` allowlist should be replaced by new sessions using `fetch_content`.

Scout allows `mcp` for discovery and single calls; add `mcpScript` if batching is needed. Without the adapter, scout falls back to local file tools. Configure CodeGraph or other servers through the adapter in the child's config/cwd; connections are not inherited from the parent. `mcp:server-name` frontmatter syntax is not supported by this extension. The gateway can access all configured servers: scout's read-only instructions are not an enforced MCP permission boundary. Restrict server operations separately when required.

The old `registerToolExtension(name, path)` hook has been removed; enable the extension in Pi settings instead.

## Role folders

`cwd` starts a sub-agent in a directory with its own config, so role-specific setups (CLAUDE.md, skills, extensions) apply:

```
project/
└── agents/
    ├── game-designer/   ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
    └── sre/             ← CLAUDE.md, .pi/…
```

```typescript
subagent({ agent: "worker", cwd: "agents/sre", task: "Review the deployment pipeline" });
```

Set a per-agent default with `cwd:` in frontmatter.

## Status widget & configuration

The widget tracks each sub-agent from a runtime activity snapshot written by the child: `starting`, `active` (turn/provider/tool work), `waiting` (open for input or another stage), `stalled` (no valid snapshot for too long), or `running` (fallback). Sub-agent sessions also show their own tools widget — toggle it with `Ctrl+Alt+O`. Completion messages expand with `Ctrl+O`.

Status display is configured via `config.json` in the extension directory (copy `config.json.example`; it's gitignored):

```json
{
  "status": { "enabled": true }
}
```
